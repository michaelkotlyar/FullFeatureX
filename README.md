# FullFeatureX
A boilerplate, dashboard themed, application with user authentication capabilities. This is really just a side project for myself, but it's completely free for anyone to use.

## Resources
### Frontend
* **[Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com)** - Layout and base styling
* **[HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com)** - Layout metadata and icons setup (Still currently using the favicon and icons from this boilerplateâ€¦)

### Backend
* **[PostgreSQL](http://postgresguide.com)** - This app is built for accessing a PostgreSQL database. The module I use to broker this is [knex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/knex). Knex also supports other database management systems.
* **[Knex](http://knexjs.org/) + [Obection.js](http://vincit.github.io/objection.js/)** - An ORM module I have recently adopted onto the project.
* **[Passport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport)** - This module is used to authenticate and create user sessions. It used to be the bane of my existence, but now, I think I've gotten the use of it.

You need a set of CLI tools to run this app. Make sure you have [Node Package Manager (npm)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed first.

* [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Knex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp) `npm install -g knex`
* [Gulp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp) `npm install -g gulp`
* [Mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha) `npm install -g mocha`
* [PostgreSQL (psql)](http://postgresguide.com/setup/install.html). Make sure your database server is running for the installation.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository into your desired directory  
	`$ git clone https://github.com/uzimike/FullFeatureX.git`

2. Change the name of `.env-sample` to `.env`. And make any necessary changes to the file variables.

## Testing
The testing side of this project is somewhat a bit of a wasteland. That being said, there are currently a few tests written and set up. To run the tests, all you have to do is run `npm test`.

The tests are currently stored in `fullfeaturex/test/test.js`. Have a look at [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [chai](http://chaijs.com/) to see how to use this.

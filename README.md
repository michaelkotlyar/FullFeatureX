# FullFeatureX
This is just another NodeJS Application that acts as a starter template. However, **I wouldn't officially consider it a starter template**. It still has many bugs and blank areas in it. And I have many more features I want to add to it. But since it's publicly available, I may as well promote it as such.

This project is mostly made for my personal use - to learn and condition myself for NodeJS development. **I have no clue if anyone will find this useful**. If you happen to want to use this, then by all means use it! But **be warned**. It's still a work in progress and may be a bit confusing to configure, for I have not put in much thought into the whole structure of the app.

## Features
### *Current* feature list
- Database connection
- User authentication
- Responsive layout
- Unit testing
- User profile editing

### *Future* feature list
- User authentication from other sources (e.g. Facebook, Google+)
- User media storage
- Things I haven't thought of yet

## Resources
Mentionable resources that I configure throughout the project

### Frontend
* **[Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com)** - Layout and base styling
* **[HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com)** - Layout metadata and icons setup (Still currently using the favicon and icons from this boilerplateâ€¦)

### Backend
* **[PostgreSQL](http://postgresguide.com)** - This app is built for accessing a PostgreSQL database. The module I use to broker this is [pg-promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg-promise).
* **[Passport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport)** - This module is used to authenticate and create user sessions. It used to be the bane of my existence, but now, I think I've gotten the use of it.

# FullFeatureX
A boilerplate, dashboard themed, application with user authentication capabilities. This is really just a side project for myself, but it's completely free for anyone to use.

## Resources
### Frontend
* **[Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com)** - Layout and base styling
* **[HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com)** - Layout metadata and icons setup (Still currently using the favicon and icons from this boilerplateâ€¦)

### Backend
* **[PostgreSQL](http://postgresguide.com)** - This app is built for accessing a PostgreSQL database. The module I use to broker this is [Knex.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/knex). Knex also supports other database management systems.
* **[Knex.js](http://knexjs.org/) + [Objection.js](http://vincit.github.io/objection.js/)** - An ORM module I have recently adopted onto the project.
* **[Passport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport)** - This module is used to authenticate and create user sessions. It used to be the bane of my existence, but now, I think I've gotten the use of it.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
You need a set of CLI tools to run this app. Make sure you have [Node Package Manager (npm)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed first.

* [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Knex.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/knex) `npm install -g knex`
* [Gulp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp) `npm install -g gulp`
* [Mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha) `npm install -g mocha`
* [PostgreSQL](http://postgresguide.com/setup/install.html) (client & CLI)  
Make sure your database server is running for the installation.

### Installation Instructions
These instructions assume you have installed the [prerequisites](#prerequisites), like using command-line, and you are using PostgreSQL as your DBMS. You can use other databases such as [SQLite3](http://sqlite.org/) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) according to [Objection.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/objection) and [Knex.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/knex).

1. Clone this repository into your desired directory  
	`$ git clone https://github.com/uzimike/FullFeatureX.git`

2. Change the name of `.env-sample` to `.env`. And make any necessary changes to the file variables.

3. Go to application directory  
   `$ cd  directory-to/fullfeaturex`

4. Install the dependencies  
   `$ npm install`

5. Enter the PostgreSQL CLI  
   `$ psql`

6. Create your database  
   `# create database fullfeaturex;`

7. Create your test database  
   `# create database fullfeaturex_test;`

8. Exit the PostgreSQL CLI  
   `# \q`

9. In the fullfeaturex directory, migrate knex  
   `$ knex migrate:latest`

10. Run the knex seed  
  `$ knex seed:run`

11. Run gulp  
   `$ gulp`

## Testing
`npm test`

There are a few tests currently stored in `fullfeaturex/test/*.js`. Have a look at [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [chai](http://chaijs.com/) to see how to use this. [jscs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jscs) and [jshint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jshint) is used to check for configurable coding syntax. [nyc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nyc) is used for testing coverage.

This project uses [git-hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/git-hooks) and tests the project at every commit (only if there is any `*.js` files in the commit).

## Notes
### Preset accounts
In the development environment, there are three accessible users accounts in the user database.

**Michael**

    username: Michael
    password: michael

**Borat**

    username: Borat
    password: borat

**Admin**

    username: Admin
    password: admin

The rest that you see in the `/users` page are [faker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker) accounts generated when seeding data into the database. The passwords are practically unknown.

### Subresource Integrity
The [bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap), [popper.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/popper.js) and [jquery](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery) libraries are referenced in `/src/server/views/layout.pug`. Their integrity attributes are generated from their file content and should be regenerated every time the respective module is updated. [Here's a good resource on this](https://truveris.github.io/articles/subresource-integrity/).

## Contribution
I personally intend for this project to be my own work. However, if there are any improvements you'd like to suggest, you're more than welcome to contact me about it.

It doesn't mean I owe you anything, though :triumph:
